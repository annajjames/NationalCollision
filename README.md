## Introduction
Police-reporting of motor vehicle collisions on public roads in Canada tracks a number of variables relating to the collisions like:
    - month, day, time
    - number of vehicles involved
    - type of collision, eg. rear-end, head-on, etc.
    - place of collision, eg. intersection, ramp, rail-road crossing, etc.
    - weather
    - type of road surface, eg. dry, wet, snow, etc.
    - traffic condition, eg. traffic signal operational, stop-sign, etc.
    - vehicle type
    - age and sex of the driver
    and a list of other features.

In our study we examined national collision data from 2019 and analyzed the variables affecting a collision leading to injury or fatality or no injury.

## Objective
To develop a classification model to predict whether or not a particular collision will lead to an injury or fatality or no injury.

This model could be used by authorities to predict collision output based on the given variables and help plan road infrastructure or put up appropriate billboards like 'accident prone zone'/'slow'down' for collision prone areas, times, etc.
